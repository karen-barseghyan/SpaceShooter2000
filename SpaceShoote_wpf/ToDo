1. Find graphics, an abandonware game should be good enough. No licensing problems. - DONE
2. Find a way to use graphics from this game for our own. 
   This point will take a while, there are no sprites available online, so I have to take screenshots of the game and edit the graphics myself.
3. Design graphics and levels.
4. Design enemies and bosses.
5. Design UI.
6. Program it all.
   Further expanded in "ProgrammingToDo"
7. Get a working prototype, one enemy and one level.
8. Implement eye-candy and finish all else, including the UI.
9. Celebrate!
